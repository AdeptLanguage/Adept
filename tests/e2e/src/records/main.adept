// - The variable '$' is a specially named variable that is impossible to have conflicts with
// - The value '$' is always treated as plain-old-data (POD) and is zero initialized during creation
// - The arguments are always passed as plain-old-data (POD)
// - The arguments are always assigned to fields NOT as plain-old-data (POD)
