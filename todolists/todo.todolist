# GROUPED VERSION OF TODO SECTION OF VERBOSE.TODOLIST
#        CREATED FRIDAY OCTOBER 11 2019
# --------------------------------------------

FEATURE:
* Test type of polymorphic type - 'if $Unit Damagable'
* Finish 'Any'
    * Fill in offsets for AnyStructType types
    * Casting to Any from non-builtin types
* __String__ function?
* Override for [] += -= *= /= %= operators
* fallthrough

VERIFICATION:
* ir_to_llvm_type circular containment detection
* Throw errors for fields with duplicate names in structs
* Dont allow void in places it doesn't make sense
* Make meta directives less error prone
* Don't allow multiple polymorphic types with the same name and number of parameters

COMPLETENESS:
* __defer__ __pass__ for fixed arrays maybe
* Allow polymorphic names for generic bases
* Add '__compiler_version__' as a builtin meta value
* Allow for self-referencing pointers
* != management function
* Allow '==' constants to be given to 'case'
* Bitwise assignment operators '&=' '|=' '^=', '<<=', '>>=', '<<<=', '>>>='
* Support 64-bit numeric literals without suffixes
* Better error messages for when not using 'usize' for <$T> List.remove()
* Allow for temporary mutable values so you can do stuff like "Hello World".clone()

UNINTENDED:
* Prevent single line functions returning void
* Fix bug with #if as statement for single line if
* Fix bug with defer statements being unfufilled if function ends with #end

TOOL:
* pragma runtime_safe
* pragma project_root 'main.adept'

DEBUG:
* improve compiler memory tracking

SPEED:
* Dont search through global variables linearly

IDEA:
* 'Super' keyword type which is the primary parent struct
* 'super' keyword which is the same as (this as *Super)
* String.adept ideas: // prepare, ready, append, appendOnce, remove, fracture, distance, contains, getUntil, getUntilOneOf, atUntil, atUntilOneOf, deleteUntil, deleteUntilOneOf, getUntilLast, count, upper, lower, empty, in-place versions etc., removeFromFront, trim, extractDATATYPEs, words?, etc.
* 'repeat cache' and 'each Type in cache [array, length]'
* Option to print parameter names for function suggestions --more-info
* Do constant casting when available and allow casting for switch cases
* Add support multiple value cases for switch
* Maybe have a 'break' like thing for skipping over the rest of a case in a switch statement?
* Add type """classes""" to catagorizes types such as ~__primitive__, ~__enum__, ~__struct__, etc.
* Add way to do "synergy"s between modules
