# GROUPED VERSION OF TODO SECTION OF VERBOSE.TODOLIST
#        CREATED FRIDAY OCTOBER 11 2019
# --------------------------------------------

FEATURE:
* Add ability to specifiy arguments to func & to get specific function
* Test type of polymorphic type - 'if $Unit Damagable'
* Similar-struct prerequisites
* Finish 'Any'
    * Fill in offsets for AnyStructType types
    * Casting to Any from non-builtin types
* __String__ function?
* Override for [] += -= *= /= %= operators
* Make x++ statement
* fallthrough

VERIFICATION:
* ir_to_llvm_type circular containment detection
* Throw errors for fields with duplicate names in structs
* Dont allow void in places it doesn't make sense
* Better error messages for 'Undeclared method'
* Prevent duplicate cases for switch

COMPLETENESS:
* __defer__ __pass__ for fixed arrays maybe
* Allow statements such as '&it as *Region.adjustPosition(xAdjustment, yAdjustment)'
* Make struct domains work with polymorphic structs

UNINTENDED:
* More support for casting pointers to and from integers

TOOL:
* pragma runtime_safe
* pragma project_root 'main.adept'

DEBUG:
* improve compiler memory tracking

SPEED:
* Dont search through global variables linearly

IDEA:
* 'Super' keyword type which is the primary parent struct
* 'super' keyword which is the same as (this as *Super)
* String.adept ideas: // prepare, ready, append, appendOnce, remove, fracture, distance, contains, getUntil, getUntilOneOf, atUntil, atUntilOneOf, deleteUntil, deleteUntilOneOf, getUntilLast, count, upper, lower, empty, in-place versions etc., removeFromFront, trim, extractDATATYPEs, words?, etc.
* 'repeat cache' and 'each Type in cache [array, length]'
* Option to print parameter names for function suggestions --more-info
* Do constant casting when available and allow casting for switch cases
* Add support multiple value cases for switch
* Maybe have a 'break' like thing for skipping over the rest of a case in a switch statement?
